# 3 Musketeers

The 3 Musketeers is a pattern for developing software in a repeatable and consistent manner. It leverages Make as an orchestration tool to test, build, run, and deploy applications using Docker and Docker Compose. The Make and Docker/Compose commands for each application are maintained as part of the applicationâ€™s source code and are invoked in the same way whether run locally or on a CI/CD server.

![pattern-overview][linkPatternOverview]

## Why?

### Consistency

Run the same commands no matter where you are: Linux, MacOS, Windows, CI/CD tools that supports Docker like Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.

### Control

Take control of languages, versions, and tools you need, and version source control your pipelines with your preferred VCS like GitHub and GitLab

### Confidence

Test your code and pipelines locally before your CI/CD tool runs it. Feel confident that if it works locally, it will work in your CI/CD server.

## Usage

This repository is the [3musketeers.io][link3Musketeers] website. This section explains the usage on how to develop and deploy it.

```bash
# Development

# create a .env file
$ make envfile ENVFILE=env.example
# Update .env file to set VUEPRESS_HOST=vuepress_dev
# install dependencies
$ make deps
# start vuepress server in a container for local development
$ make startDev
# in a different shell session
$ make lint
$ make test
$ make clean
```

```bash
# Testing

$ make envfile ENVFILE=env.example
$ make deps
$ make lint
# start vuepress in a container in the background
$ make start
$ make test
$ make clean

# See targets `all`, `travisPullRequest`
```

```bash
# Building and Deployment

# create a .env that sets environment variables for production. For instance
$ make envfile ENVFILE=.env.production
# building the static website
$ make build
# deploy the website to Netlify
$ make deploy

# See target `travisMasterChange`
```
